-- Compare v6 and new PR merge regression resolution in Vpt bins

- Show additional plots for MET and leptons peaks
- Don't mix v5 and v6 data samples

- Working point for b-tagging is looser
- di-lepton pT could also be changed, perhaps

- jetId and puId may be tighter
- Trigger efficiencies exist
- btagWeight_DeepCSVB not used. Check what it is vs jet b-tag values

- Remove duplicate events
- Try sum of Gaussian and Landau
- Run with the custom NanoAOD at MIT
